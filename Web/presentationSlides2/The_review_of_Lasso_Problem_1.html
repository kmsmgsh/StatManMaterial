# Review the Lasso weakness

# The variable selection property for lasso-&gt; up to n variables

For the lasso form penalty problem 
`$$\hat { \beta } \in \underset { \beta \in \mathbb { R } ^ { p } } { \operatorname { argmin } } \frac { 1 } { 2 } \| y - X \beta \| _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } + \lambda \| \beta \| _ { 1 }$$`
the elastic net paper(2004) said that the lasso can only select up to n parameters. Here are two way to explain this.


---

1. The optimization way. Quote from [stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/38299/if-p-n-the-lasso-selects-at-most-n-variables)

   The lasso penalty is a optimization problem which fits the KKT condition, so we have the KKT conditon as
   `$$\left. \begin{array} { c } { X ^ { T } ( y - X \hat { \beta } ) = \lambda \gamma } \\ { \gamma _ { i } \in \left\{ \begin{array} { l l } { \left\{ \operatorname { sign } \left( \hat { \beta } _ { i } \right) \right\} } &amp; { \text { if } \hat { \beta } _ { i } \neq 0 } \\ { [ - 1,1 ] } &amp; { \text { if } \hat { \beta } _ { i } = 0 } \end{array} \right. , \text { for } i = 1 , \ldots p } \end{array} \right.$$`
   We use the main of the KKT conditon that `\(|X^T(y-X\hat\beta)|=\lambda\)`, in the abosolute value case we can omit the sub-gradient.

   This formula is a linear system with `\(\hat\beta\)`. Since the rank of the matrix `\(X\)` is up to n, so this linear system with unique result only with n line of `\(\beta\)` . Otherwise it will have infinity solutions. 	

   In another words, this type of optimization problem only solvable when active set `\(E\)` is not larger than n predictors.	

   So in such point of view, the key thing is the rank about the hat matrix. In OLS is `\(X^TX\)`.

In the mean time, the ridge-regression form is as following
$$
\hat\beta=(X^TX+\lambda I)^{-1}X^Ty
$$
The rank of hat matrix `\(X^TX+\lambda I\)` can equal to n, so it is solvable.

And for the KKT condition case, maybe because it is strictly convex, so the form of `\(\gamma\)` and the equation we use could change to
$$
`\begin{align}
X^T(y-X\hat\beta)=2\lambda\hat\beta\\
(X^TX+\lambda I)\hat\beta=X^Ty
\end{align}`
$$

Problem: For general problem
$$
\hat { \beta } = \underset { \beta } { \operatorname { argmin } } | y - X \beta | ^ { 2 } + \lambda J ( \beta )=\underset { \beta } { \operatorname { argmin } } L(\beta)
$$
If X is not column-full-rank, then the quadratic form is not strictly convex. 

Proof : The theorem about strictly convex: the first-order deriatives and second order deriatives should strictly great than 0, that is `\(L'(\beta)&gt;0\)` and `\(L''(\beta)&gt;0\)` . (Generally speaking, the deriative and 2nd order deriative(Hessian Matrix) is positive definite or semi-positive definite).

The second deriative of quadratic part of the optimization problem is `\(X^TX\)` , if `\(X\)` is not full-column-rank, then `\(X^TX\)` would be semi-positive definite rather than positive definite. Then this part can only hold the convex rather than strictly convex. 

If the penalty term also cannot hold the strictly convex, than the loss function is convex instead of strictly convex. If the penalty term is srictly convex, than a strictly convex term + convex term is strictly convex term.

## 2.The approximation to OLS view of the lasso problem.

   When lambda is small and close to 0, the lasso estimator is come close to OLS which is solvable only up to n estimators.

   The problem is, ridge regression is also close to OLS when `\(\lambda\)` comes to 0. Why this unsolvable situation do not happen to ridgeregression ?

   The answer is, ridge regression always keep all the predictor in the model, however, for lasso, the number of predictors be selected is monotonic decreaasing via `\(\lambda\)`. The number of predictor is maximized when `\(\lambda\)` close to 0, that is, the OLS case, number of predictors equals to n.

## Another point of view: the sovable condition for linear system



Another point of view is whether the unorthogonal linear system is solvable。Un orthogonal linear system is solvable if and only it fits the compatibility condition.

The compatibility condition is，the rank of Augmented matrix with response should be equal to the original matrix rank.
$$
(X^TX)\hat\beta=\lambda\gamma+X^Ty
$$
That is,

the rank of `\(X^TX\)` should equal to rank of `\((X^TX|\lambda \gamma+X^Ty)\)`.
 Because we have `\(X^Ty \in col(X)\)`，so we need only prove  `\(\lambda\gamma \mathbf{1} \not\in col(X)\)`.
---
We can write 
`$$X _ { \mathcal { E } } ^ { T } \left( y - X _ { \mathcal { E } } \hat { \beta } _ { \mathcal { E } } \right) = \lambda s$$`
That is, `\(\lambda s\)` is in the column space of `\(X_\mathcal{E}^T\)` .

In this way, this linear system is fullfil the compatibility condition in linear algebra, which is always solvable. However, the same fact always exist. Due to `\(X^TX\)` is not full-rank, even it is solvable, the number of solutions is infinity, which is meaningless in same case.
